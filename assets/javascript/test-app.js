/*
Just some thoughts on how I want this app to work
I think that aside from the history of the weather for the gps there should be displayed activities the user can do depending on the weather
Like for example I want there to be a list of books, video games and/or movies that will display when the chance of rain is >= 70%
On the other hand I want the app to show the user some hiking trails, biking trails or running routes when the chance is <= 50%
If the app shows the user books or video games I want there to be a list of some of the more popular/tranding items that they can select and in a card display show a picture, title, possibly rating as well as a review of said item.
I think that the list should also have some checkbox options. Like if they want to see only books to select the box.
